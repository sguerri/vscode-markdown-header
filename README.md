> Markdown YAML header editor for vscodium and vscode

This is an extension for [vscodium](https://vscodium.com/) and [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

For markdown files having a YAML header, it displays a sidebar with header details.

I will enhance the extension as per my daily usage or others' feedbacks.

**Main features**
* Display header items by type
* Add a YAML header if not existing
* Add / Remove header item
* Update value depending the header type
* Choice selection per header item as per global / project settings
* Switch boolean value true <-> false

**Roadmap**
* Edit array items
* Edit float numbers (currently check value with parseInt)
